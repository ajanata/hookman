I pay attention to several means of communication. 

=Email=
This is the most reliable way to make sure I see something, but depending on what computer I am using I may not check my email for several hours, or I may be notified within ten minutes of receiving a new message. Listed in preferred order, in slightly obscured format:
  * com.gmail@ajanata
  * com.ajanata@ajanata

=IRC=
I almost always have at least one client on EFnet. I am normally under the name of Andy_J, though variants on that theme may exist if I am connected in more than one place. I idle in #tcpa (a gathering place of the TI calculator community), among other more obscure channels.

=Instant Messaging=
If you choose to IM me, please make your intentions clear in the first message or I'll ignore you. Listed in preferred order:
  * AIM: !AkronAndyZip or !AkronAndyLaptop
  * GTalk: ajanata@gmail.com
  * ICQ: 61051061 (rarely connected)
